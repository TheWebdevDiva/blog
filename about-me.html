                <h2>Hi, I'm Michelle!</h2>

                <p><strong>Perfection is boring.</strong> People spend most of their lives desperately trying to impress others. Many are in jobs that aren't the least bit fulfilling, or in relationships that aren't satisfying.</p>

                <h3>How I turned things around</h3>
                <p><strong>I was on the verge of a burnout when I decided what I was doing with my life was no longer working for me</strong>. I literally made the decision to walk away from the apartment I was renting, the draining relationship, and the toxic work environment.</p>
                <p>It was easier than I thought to make that pivot. And I'm glad I did!</p>

                <h3>>Now I'm living life on my terms</h3>
                <p>Now that I'm making the conscious choice to strive towards the person whom I want to become, things are so much more satisfying. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and my career more, and I have more free time to just be ME!</p>
                <p>With how much I was able to live more on purpose and turn my life around, <strong>I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it</strong>, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!</p>
